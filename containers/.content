			<p>
				Container platforms such as Docker are lightweight hosting
				environments for applications. When the application package is
				assembled, it includes all the application modules, libraries,
				and system code needed to run the application within a
				container. The container is executed within the container engine
				which runs directly on the server's operating system (OS).
				Multiple containerized applications run within the container
				engine on one OS. This reduces the overhead compared to
				virtualization, which runs a kernel that hosts multiple virtual
				machines (VMs), each VM runs its own OS and subsequent
				applications built for that OS.
			</p>
			<p>
				Using Containers, a company can reduce the number of OS
				instances running on the server, which reduces the load on the
				server hardware. It also may reduce cost by reducing the number
				of OS licenses needed in the environment.
