				"Cloud Computing" is a general term that denotes a service
				provided by a service provider, typically accessed via the
				Internet. For example, this website is hosted by an ISP
				(Internet Service Provider) and is available via the internet.
				Cloud also includes services that are hosted by and ISP, that
				are exclusively available to your company via a Virtual Private
				Network (VPN) connection. The type of services can vary from
				full server environments to specific services like a storage
				archive or a website.
			</p>
			<p>
				When discussing cloud computing, it is often helpful to
				differentiate what service(s) are needed, and whether the
				hosting environment is private (available only from your
				corporate network), or public (offering services to external
				users via the Internet).
			</p>
			<p>
				The attraction of Cloud Computing is that you only pay for what
				you use, and you are able to scale up or down based on the
				current demand.
