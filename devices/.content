				The organization leadership must understand the risks and costs
				as well as the estimated ROI for providing remote or mobile
				access. Technology evolution has changed the access platform
				from a terminal, to a variety of devices with varying
				capabilities and screen sizes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Company issued laptops are a common solution to remote access,
				but limit the ability of employees to "work from anywhere." End
				users want to access their files from anywhere, anytime, from
				any device. This is becoming more possible, but brings added
				complexity and risk. The organization needs a documented policy
				on what is permitted, and the user's responsibilities. A
				"Remote/Mobile User Agreement" is usual, signed by the user and
				kept with the employee's HR records.
			</p>

				Most organizations also require an "App" for personal
				smartphones connecting to the corporate network. The App will
				create a sandbox on the smartphone where all corporate documents
				are stored. If the employee leaves the company, the sandbox is
				removed, removing all corporate information from the user's
				device.
