			<p>
				Enterprise Technical Architecture (ETA) defines the technologies
				that are used to build the IT environment that supports the
				Enterprise Architecture. It also defines the controls that
				maintain the business segmentation as defined by the Enterprise
				Architecture. The ETA is a supporting framework for the EA and
				must refine the EA into appropriate technical frameworks that
				provide the flexibility and security needed to operate the
				business.
