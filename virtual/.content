			<p>
				As computer hardware increased in capability, virtualization
				emerged to take advantage of unused CPU cycles with moderate
				additional expense. Virtualization extended the life of many
				data centers which were near capacity for power and cooling by
				reducing the physical server footprint. As traditional IT
				departments became familiar with and deployed virtualization for
				their internal servers, they learned the core conceptual
				framework to begin using cloud hosting for new services or
				on-demand surge processing.

				From an operational perspective, virtualization reduces cost and
				increases flexibility in work load distribution. However,
				organizations have to remember to maintain copies of their
				virtual metadata (VM configurations, network connections,
				environment capabilities, etc.) for reference and use in a
				disaster recovery scenario.
