Storage

			<p>
				Directly attached storage (DAS), as the name implies, is plugged
				into and controlled by a server. It is dedicated to the server
				and originally held the operating system and all applications &
				data that ran on the server.
			</p>
			<p>
				As technology evolved, storage has moved to shared resource
				pools configured in Storage Area Networks (SAN) and Network
				Attached Storage (NAS). This allows the storage to grow as
				needed without forcing changes to the server configuration,
				reducing complexity and cost associated with storage capacity
				changes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Creating a tiered storage architecture is also common because
				modern data-hungry applications such as analytics or data mining
				can be matched to the appropriate storage platform based on
				their value to the business. For example, a Wall Street trading
				analytic application may need all-flash storage ($$$$) for
				performance where the ROI justifies the expense. On the other
				hand, mining the last two decades of sales data for trends to
				determine appropriate inventory volume for the next year may be
				housed on disk storage ($$) due the non-urgent nature of the
				results.
