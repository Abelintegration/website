			<p>
				Enterprise Architecture considers the enterprise as a system
				where information flows between groups, departments, divisions,
				or subsidiary companies, with the intent of providing the
				customer a timely and unique product or service.
			</p>
			<p>
				Enterprise architecture looks at the applications, processes,
				and information as it moves through the organization to identify
				where additional information may be beneficial to the internal
				decision making, or could benefit the customer experience. Note
				that customers can be both internal and external, and that
				information access should be based on authenticated identity.
			</p>
			<p>
				Enterprise Architecture must be able to answer the following questions:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					What is the organizations primary business / purpose?
				</li>
				<li>
					What are the organization's priorities?
				</li>
				<li>
					What are the organization's capabilities?
				</li>
				<li>
					What external regulatory requirements are relevant (GDPR,
				federal, state, local, etc.)?
				</li>
				<li>
					How does the organization effectively address and maintain
				regulatory compliance, while enabling the business to operate as
				securely and efficiently as possible?
				</li>
				<li>
					Where is the organization growing, and how can Enterprise
					Architecture facilitate the growth?
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Developing an Enterprise Architecture (EA) is a significant
				effort that may take years to design and fully integrate into
				the business processes and culture. Because EA is a large effort
				that effects the entire enterprise by definition, it often helps
				to start with an initial target area that is well defined. This
				makes the initial efforts more manageable and allows the
				organization to observe the process and impacts to understand
				the benefits. Seeing results in the initial target area allows
				others in the enterprise to understand and consider what
				benefits they may be able to achieve in their own area.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another way to accelerate the success of EA is by engaging an
				experienced consultant that understands the industry, regulatory
				landscape, and market direction. This can significantly decrease
				the design and planning time and increase the deployment &
				adoption speed.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are several frameworks to develop and maintain an EA based
				on the industry and regulatory environment for the enterprise.
				Some examples include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					FEA – Federal Enterprise Architecture framework; used in the
					US Federal government departments and agencies.
				</li>
				<li>
					Gartner - Developed by Gartner for private industry. It uses
					a custom framework and methods.
				</li>
				<li>
					TOGAF - The Open Group Architecture Framework. Developed
					over time across multiple industries to include tools and
					methods that can be adapted to most enterprises. The
					advantage is that it is well known. The disadvantage is that
					the practitioners have to select the appropriate tools to
					apply to the specific implementation.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Zachman Framework - Developed by John Zachman who was
					one of the pioneers of Enterprise Architecture. It describes
					the enterprise by developing a taxonomy of information
					within the enterprise and describes information connections
					across the enterprise. By analyzing how: data, function,
					network, people, time, and motivation are experienced
					through the perspectives of planner, owner, designer,
					builder, subcontractor, and enterprise; the Zachman
					framework illustrates how your company can optimize
					operations.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The above four examples are well established, but there are
				several other frameworks designed to optimize organizational
				functioning such as: DDAF (US) Department of Defense
				Architecture Framework, IT-COBIT, IT-ITIL, PEAF, and SOA. Each
				of these frameworks are designed to document & optimize
				functions within/across an organization or develop and
				illustrate a particular aspect of the organization.
			</p>
			<p>
				Selecting the framework for your organization may seem simple
				based the industry. i.e. a federal agency may be required to use
				the FEA, however, if a majority of the agency work is performed
				via subcontracts, the EA may be more easily developed and more
				effective by using a framework that the subcontractor personnel
				are already familiar with. Surveying the environment to
				understand the population effected (who will be performing the
				architecture practices) and the existing knowledge base, may
				lead to an alternate framework selection.
			</p>
			<p>
				The framework selection is important and should be deliberately
				considered and discussed within your organization's current
				context. However, the decision should not paralyze the
				organization while it is being deliberated. Many of the
				artifacts developed under one framework can be adapted to another.
			</p>
			<p><i>
				The value of EA is in the creation, distribution, and use of
				information across the organization to reduce duplication of
				effort, rework, and increase the reuse of solutions already
				developed.
