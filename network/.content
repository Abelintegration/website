			<p>
				For all businesses that want to stay relevant in today's
				economy, an internet presence is required. The internet is also
				typically used to perform business to business (B2B)
				transactions (e.g. email, application updates, etc.).
				Additionally, if the business operates in multiple locations, a
				private network for internal company business may also be
				required.
			</p>
			<p>
				Current Software Defined [SD] WAN network technology can enable
				a global private network securely over the Internet using the
				same low-cost connections that provide internet access.
			</p>
			<p>
				As the number of connections and applications increases, so does
				the complexity of maintaining the network environment. The
				increasing demand for inter-site and global networking has
				created high demand for networking professionals that have
				knowledge of current techniques and technologies. Technical
				Architecture professionals are required to review new network
				technologies for applicability, functionality, and maturity to
				determine when piloting and adoption is appropriate for your
				organization.
