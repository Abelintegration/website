				Servers used to be semi-autonomous, each containing the
				resources needed to perform a specific task (provide an
				application, file storage, etc.). However, they were configured
				for peak loads which left significant processing resources
				un-used.
			</p>
			<p>
				Virtualization has almost eliminated the traditional bastion
				host, and instead offers resources on-demand for virtual
				workloads. However, virtualization brings complexity along with
				flexibility. For example, virtual hosts can be clustered to
				allow workloads to move around within a cluster, including
				automated reconstitution of services should a single host fail.
				However, automated failover rules have to be established as part
				of the configuration:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					What services are allowed to migrate to another server in
					the cluster?
				</li>
				<li>
					What are the priority services?
				</li>
				<li>
					Will there be reserved capacity to accommodate a node
					failure, or will we shutdown lower priority services?
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The failure scenarios and recovery priorities & procedures
				should be considered and documented in a Runbook for the
				operational staff to reference in the event of a failure.
				Capacity planning has to account for the normal load, surge
				processing, and also for different failure and failover
				capabilities to keep the business functioning at a planned
				service level in the event of a natural or human-caused
				disaster.
